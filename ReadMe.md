<h1>Welcome to the 100 Days Of Code Challenge in JavaScript.</h1>

<h3>I decided to commit to this challenge to improve my JavaScript Skills</h3>
  <p>While doing this project I also incorporated HTML, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap</p>
  <p>I also utilized various packages such as Three.js and Spring.js </p>
  <h3> Throughout this journey I discovered:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> I love working with animation packages and I love animating websites </li>
    <li> I truly enjoy frontend web devlopment </li>
    <li> I am curious about other libraries and frameworks such as Reactjs </li>
  </ul>

<h4>My discovery made me realize that I should start working with JavaScript in the React library so I am essentially working on both at the same time.</h4>
<p> That is why on day day 66 I started working on React. </p>
  <p> So from day 66 onward will all be projects created in React.</p>

<h4>Every day I finished a JS / React project. </h5>
